    <p><img src='/images/me.jpg'></p>
    <p>I have been involved in theatre and stage production since a very early age when I “helped” my father with his
      community and church lighting projects. In high school I was heavily involved in the then-new purpose built
      theatre, including helping design and operate the lighting for numerous school productions and external concerts.
    </p>
    <p>Having been bitten by the bug, I soon became involved in the amateur theatre scene in Melbourne, and spent many
      years crewing and designing musicals. I was able to use this experience to find employment on a number of major
      commercial productions, including The Phantom of the Opera, The New Rocky Horror Show, and 42nd Street for the
      Australian tours.</p>
    <p>After a few years break to raise a family, I am now rekindling my love of theatre and lighting.</p>
