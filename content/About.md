# About me

I have been involved in theatre and stage production since a very
early age when I "helped" my father with his community and church
lighting projects. In high school I was heavily involved in the
then-new purpose built theatre, including helping design and operate
the lighting for numerous school productions and external concerts.

Having been bitten by the bug, I soon became involved in the amateur
theatre scene in Melbourne, and spent many years crewing and designing
musicals. I was able to use this experience to find employment on a
number of major commercial productions, including The Phantom of the
Opera, The New Rocky Horror Show, and 42nd Street for the Australian
tours.

After a few years break to raise a family, I am now rekindling my love
of theatre and lighting.

I am able to provide lighting design and consulting services for
community and school theatre productions.

Please drop me a line if you have any questions.
